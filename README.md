# Self-Assessment
*Presents a cohesive written analysis that describes the role(s) they played over the course of the project and their contribution to the project in that role.*
Originally, our team consisted of five members.  Four were active participants in the final project, and while the module outlined the rotation of duties, each member of our team found themselves specializing in certain kinds of tasks.  I started in the circle role, and while I kept that role throughout the project, my particular area of focus was our database.  Throughout the last six months, I've found my greatest strength to be big data management in the Python programming language and its associated libraries.  I love Python--it has changed the way I work and think--and I put myself forward early on to handle "all things data."  While the team selected our subject cooperatively, I: 1) performed troubleshooting on the original dataset, 2) assembled a comprehensive working dataframe, 3) cleaned and processed that dataframe, 4) divided it into dependent dataframes containing keys (for graphs and charts) and values (for the machine learning model). 5) sent dataframes to CSV/Github for use by other team members, 6) performed exploratory analysis using matplotlib, 7) joined dependent dataframes into a comprehensive database in SQL, and 8) sent the comrephensive database to an S3 bucket for pickup by Amazon Web Services.

*Presents a cohesive written summary of how they contributed to each of the roles they did not take on via team discussions, peer reviews, or other means.*
Our team was incredibly supportive of each other, and I gave as much energy and enthusiasm as I got, which was plenty.  We had fascinating discussions around this dataset, some of which wandered off into the (always informative) weeds.  I certainly hope I helped my teammates as much as they supported me, and I'd say my main contributions to each of them were as follows.  To support the team member handling the machine learning portion, I processed and cleaned the dataset extensively, cutting it down based on a variety of factors, filtering out unhelpful variables and columns, passing values and keys between each other as needed.  I provided the comprehensive database and its component datasets in multiple formats and via multiple platforms, and attempted to make data "machine ready" by the time it passed to him.  For the team member handling Tableau, I performed exploratory analysis of the data in our .ipynb files, in the hopes of giving him at lease a few starting directions for the dashboard and final visualizations.  Following initial exploratory analysis, I did final cleaning and made add'l dataframes to support easy feeding of data into Tableau.  For the team member handling Github, I helped her through the creation of new branches, summarizing/describing my work for translation into the project README, and troubleshooting code.

*Additionally, the analysis should describe their greatest personal challenge over the course of the project, and how they overcame that challenge.*

# Team Assessment
*Presents a cohesive written analysis that describes their teamwork, including all of the following:*

*Their communication protocol, including any challenges, how they were resolved, and what they would do differently next time*

*Their strengths as a team, including tips and tricks they would want to share with a new cohort kicking off the project*

# Summary of Project
*Presents a cohesive, three- to four-sentence summary of the project that could be used on a LinkedIn profile, in an interview or cover letter, or as an elevator pitch, including all of the following:*

*Topic addressed*

*Machine module used*

*Results of the analysis*
